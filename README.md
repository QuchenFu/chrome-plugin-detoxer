Behold this plugin, crafted with care
Based on Perspective API, it's rare
A shield to guard against trolls and woe
And take back control, don't you know?

Just get a key, paste it with ease
In background.js, it's a breeze
Install and pin in Chrome, it's done
Your digital world, now you've won

Visit a website, scroll down below
Load enough content, don't be slow
Click the plugin icon, see it shine
And leave those trolls far behind.
